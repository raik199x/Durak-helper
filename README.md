Durak helper is a program, that SHOULD help you to play this game (card game)

You write in console cards that played on board and program will remember all cards that played\was taken (by you or enemy) and of course it shows you enemy cards in the end of game

That SHOULD be a good idea, but, in real life it is uncomfortable to write and play. If you a good at this game, do not even try to use it =)
But if you intersted in my idea, you can check it (or even improve)
There could be bugs (especially if you write something wrong, i were too lazy to write all checkers)

Feel free to use it (god damn no) and, as always, enjoy yourself =)
